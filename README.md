## 3DKeyboardBuilder

*Live Renderer*: https://kaansoral.github.io/3DKeyboardBuilder/

### State of the Project
Currently I'm just releasing my functional prototype, it's hardcoded for an 60% keyboard size and only supports Costar stabilisers. If you know coding, you can easily modify it to fit your needs, and use the renderer to render your keyboard, plate, plate pieces, or inlets!

### Plans
Implement a gallery of codes selectable by the user and grow with the codes submitted by the community, to collaborate: https://geekhack.org/index.php?topic=97667.0
I will publish codes whenever I work on new things, for example, I'm planning on preparing a code for 60% inlet pieces, to create an 3.5MM solid layer that can be placed under regular 1.5MM metal plates, for sound isolation and rigidity

### Thanks
I've been searching for a Programmer oriented CAD system for a while, one can do simple add and subtract operations. It was a joyous moment discovering http://joostn.github.io/OpenJsCad/ which builds upon https://evanw.github.io/csg.js/ - Thanks to those projects, much can be done on browsers, with just a few lines of code.

Thanks to swill for open sourcing his builder and being a reference for stabiliser positions: https://github.com/swill/kb_builder
