## 3DKeyboardBuilder

*Live Renderer*: https://kaansoral.github.io/3DKeyboardBuilder/

### State of the Project
Currently I'm just releasing my functional prototype, it's hardcoded for an 60% keyboard size and only supports Costar stabilisers. But if you know coding, you can easily modify it to fit your needs, and use the renderer to practically render your keyboard, plate, plate pieces, or inlets in your browser!

### Plans
Implement a gallery of Codes selectable by the user and grow by the codes submitted by the community, to collaborate: https://geekhack.org/index.php?topic=97667.0

### Thanks
I've been searching for a Programmer oriented CAD system for a while, one can do simple add and subtract operations. It was a joyous moment discovering http://joostn.github.io/OpenJsCad/ which builds upon https://evanw.github.io/csg.js/ - Thanks to those projects, much can be done on browsers, with just a few lines of code.

Thanks to swill for open sourcing his builder and being a reference for stabiliser positions: https://github.com/swill/kb_builder
